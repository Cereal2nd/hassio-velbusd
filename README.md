# Home Assistant VelbusD addon

This addon basically implements [Velbus TCP](https://github.com/velbus/python-velbustcp) as a home-assistant addon.

## Installation
1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to <kbd>Settings</kbd> -> <kbd>Add-ons</kbd> -> <kbd>Add-on Store (Bottom Right)</kbd>.
2. Click the 3-dots menu at upper right <kbd>...</kbd> > <kbd>Repositories</kbd> and add this repository's URL: [https://github.com/Cereal2nd/hassio-velbusd/](https://github.com/Cereal2nd/hassio-velbusd/)
3. Reload the page , scroll to the bottom to find the new repository, and click the new add-on named "Home Assistant Google Drive Backup":
   Note: Home Assistant loads the repository in the background and the new item won't always show up automatically.  You might need to wait a few seconds and then "hard refesh" the page for it to show up.  On most browser the keyboard shortcut for this is CTRL+F5. If it still doesn't show up, clear your browser's cache and it should then.
5. Click <kbd>Install</kbd> and give it a few minutes to finish downloading.
6. Click on <kbd>Configuration</kbd> in the top menu
7. Select the device that mentions <kbd>Velleman</kbd>.
9. Click <kbd>Start</kbd>, give it a few seconds to spin up.
10. Look at the <kbd>Logs</kbd> page to see if the system is starting corectly
